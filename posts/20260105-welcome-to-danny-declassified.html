<h1>Schizophrenia – The New Weapon in the Fight Against Terrorism</h1>

<p>It has long been known that wireless transmission via vibrations to the bones of the skull can be perceived. Receiving music and messages is also possible through this mechanism.</p>

<p>Over the course of the major “War on Terror,” Western countries had one big problem above all: sleeper cells. Potential threats.</p>

<p>People who moved more or less under the radar of the security services, who did not break any major laws—until one day they struck and cost countless human lives. And those in power were tired of being unable to do anything, because a preventive arrest ran counter to every legal framework and might also have exposed intelligence sources. And always waiting until another terrorist attack happened was dreadful.</p>

<p>In those days, the Americans were by no means squeamish, and the Europeans had also had enough of their helplessness against this menace. And the Americans acted.</p>

<p>The following plan was devised: individuals classified as supposed threats were subjected to the latest technology. The transmission worked excellently. Suddenly these people “heard” voices—directly in their heads. And when these voices posed as God, the devil, or who knows what, most of those affected became more than nervous. After a few days they were actually insane, because it had been studied that panic, traumatic experiences, and mortal fear could trigger psychoses in this way: delusions. And if, all of a sudden, their God speaks up directly in their head—and they are believers—then that can be frightening. And if the “God” suddenly becomes unfriendly, they can quite easily experience mortal fear. And so it happened: threat after threat was brought to psychiatry and thus more or less neutralized. It didn’t work one hundred percent. Again and again there were threats who, mentally ill or not, carried out an attack. And in Germany, since 2012, there has not been a single threat who carried out an attack and was not mentally ill. This may show you the scale of this program.</p>

<p>And of course mistakes happened. Collateral damage in the fight against terrorism. At first it was only one person. Then it became several: people who were classified as threats because of some kind of irregularity—and suddenly went insane. And from then on they were monitored. And of course they lost all credibility. If you are admitted to a hospital with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, then in our society you have lost all respect. Officially you are a “madman.” As terrible as it is for those affected, the program continued. There was no defense for the “threats”; there were only accusers, judges, and executioners all in one.</p>

<p>And the program is still active.</p>

<p>Until 2014, no one asked why Islamist threats were so frequently seeking help from presumably rather worldly psychotherapists. Until it became noticeable—and since then, all perpetrators are still mentally ill, but officially they are not, or only partially, monitored by the authorities.</p>

<p>Are other countries already using this technology as well? To motivate threats treated in this way to carry out attacks in time before elections?</p>

<p>Do we still control the spirit we ourselves let out of the bottle?</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
